Exercises for the course "Industrial software development in Java" (Innopolis University, STC-15 Group)

LESSON 2. Write 3 programs
As homework, you need to write 3 programs:
1.	A program that calculates the cost of gasoline (Input: the number of liters; Output: the purchase price). 
Example: the cost of a liter of gasoline is 43 rubles. 50 is input, the output should be 2150 rubles.
2.	A program that calculates the salary after taxes (Input: the salary before taxes, Output: the salary after 13% PIT.) 
Example: Input: 70,000, Output: 60,900.
3.	A program that converts seconds to hours. 
Example: Input: 3600, Output: 1 hour.

LESSON 3 Update programs from the lesson ¹2 + additional task
1.	Rewrite the programs from the second lesson so that user interaction would be through a standard input stream (System.in).
2. 	The game "hot-cold" 
Write a Java Console “Hot / Cold” Application
At first, the program chooses a random number from 1 to 100.
The user enters a number from the console.
The program tells the user “hot” if he is close to the “hidden” number and “cold” if not. Program allows to enter the number again and again while the user will guess the number. 
For the first user input, we consider the previous number is 0.
Consider quitting the game before it ends.

LESSON 4 Write 4 programs
1.	Write a program to find the minimum of two numbers.
2.	Write a program that describes the entered number. It is negative or positive (or zero), even or odd. 
3.	Write a program to display the multiplication tables. 
4.	Write a program that displays an arithmetic or geometric progression for N numbers.

LESSON 6 Simulate subject area
Use the acquired knowledge about object-oriented programming to simulate some subject area. 
For example: bank, university, library, warehouse, store, pond, etc. 
Requirements:
Minimum 3 classes
Multiple fields and methods
Using Access Modifiers
Using OOP principles

LESSON 7 Write an application "Vending machine"
Write the Vending Machine program, which will allow: 
•	View drinks menu
•	Deposit money into an internal account
•	Choose a number of a drink and get it if there are enough funds on the account




The program should handle the following situations:
•	The User did not deposit money
•	The user chose a more expensive drink and there is insufficient funds in the account.
•	User has selected a non-existent drink number
•	Use an array with enum or with a usual class for drinks. The drink should have a price and a name.

LESSON  8 Key words static and final
1. Experiment with the keyword “final”
2. Write the Calculator class, which will contain static methods for the operations of subtraction, addition, multiplication, division, and taking a percentage of the number. The class should work with both integers and non-integers.
3. Write a class with a counter of the number of created objects in its constructor. Write a method to get quantity information about created objects.
4. Write two classes: contract and act. Both have the fields: number, date, list of goods (array of strings). Write a class with the static method of converting the contract into an act (Input: contract, Output: we get the act).
